🔍 What does format=3 mean in the wttr.in URL?

wttr.in supports different output formats through the format parameter. These formats control how the weather data is displayed.

✅ format=3 is one of the simplest formats:
It returns a short, one-line summary:
                Karachi: ☀️ +35°C

This is:
       Clean
       Compact
       Easy for developers or scripts to display

🧱 Other Format Options in wttr.in
     Format	Example Output	Purpose
     format=1	Only weather symbols	Minimalistic
     format=2	Location + symbol only	Slightly more info
     format=3	City: 🌤 +32°C	Best for CLI / scripts
     format=j1	JSON format	For developers (API-style output)
     format=%t	Temperature only	You can customize output manually

You can even mix fields like this:
       https://wttr.in/karachi?format=%l:+%c+%t

This might output:
      Karachi: ☀️ +35°C

More format codes:
              %l: location
              %c: condition (symbol)
              %t: temperature
              %w: wind
              %h: humidity
              (And many others)

❓ Can you use format=3 in every URL?
✅ Yes — as long as you're calling wttr.in, you can use ?format=3. It’s specific to wttr.in’s custom weather API.

❌ But you can’t use format=3 in general websites or APIs — it won’t work with Google, OpenWeatherMap, or any unrelated services. It's only for wttr.in.
